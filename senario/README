# Senario 1
Here is a list for last month's computer sales' information(sn1_table.txt).
The columns separated by white spaces are represented as:
	<name> <price> <sales> <inventory>
And ther's another file recorded a single number per line for the sale amount
  in this month(sn1_input).
Now, the program is required to update the information list and output the
  new list to another file called "sn1_output.txt".
The necessary output includes modify the number of sales and inventory
  up to this month based on the number in "sn_input.txt". Calculate a new
  column for the total amount of income according to sales and price
  for each kind of computer, and append it to the end of line.
Meanwhile, for those having total income larger than $300,000, mark "(BEST)"
  at the end of computer name; for those lower than $60,000, mark "(OFFER)"
  at the end of computer name, and reduce its price to half as special offer.
